# Leveraging the Microsoft Bot Framework to operate Sitecore

This Bot was created for the SUGCON (Sitecore User Group Conference) held on May 18th and 19th 2017 in Amsterdam.

If you would like to read more about this Bot specifically you can take a look at my blog posts at https://suneco.nl/blogs/leveraging-the-microsoft-bot-framework-to-operate-sitecore

## Sitecore version
The Bot was built to work with Sitecore 8.2 update 3. For the Sitecore references I used the NuGet stream by Sitecore.
